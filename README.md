## Hi there 👋


Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Engineering at Brigham Young University - Idaho, with a prior Associate's degree in the same field from the College of Western Idaho. During my academic journey, I have developed capabilities in programming languages such as C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as front-end web development concepts like responsive design.  

As an Academic Tutor at the College of Western Idaho, I supported students in mastering programming fundamentals, including object-oriented programming and web development basics. My role also emphasized clear communication and active listening to foster learning. My goal is to contribute my technical skills to a software development role in the technology sector.
